# Zillow Enhancer

**No longer working as Zillow has updated their website.**

This script adds the ability to set a work address on Zillow.com. It then shows
the travel time and distance to/from work next to each home listing. It also adds
the ability to view travel directions on a map. This makes it much easier to plan
your commute when browsing for a new home.

Can use with Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey or you can create a bookmark with the location:
`javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("script")).src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yo1dog/zillow-enhancer/master/zillowEnhancer.js";})();`

Clicking the bookmark will run the JavaScript on the page.
